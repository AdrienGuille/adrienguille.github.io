# Swearing Habit Analysis in British Tweets

Linguistic differences between women and men is a common source of discussion. Traditional views of women as speaking more than men, or of men swearing more than women for example, fuel societal stereotypes and may thus impact people’s standards concerning what is desirable from women or men.

## Contributions

We've studied language use on Twitter, more particularly gender and age differences in swearing. Along the way, we've developed an open-source online service that allows researchers in social sciences to easily collect and analyze tweets: CATS (work presented at CSCW 2016).
